# Mobile Apps Week 7 Lab
This lab gets students to connect a React Native App to a Firebase Firestore database. The goals of the App are as follows.
- To set up a Firebase account - to create a project, app and firestore database within Firebase
- To modify an existing React Native App so that it saves some data to Firebase.
- To retreive data from Firebase and display it in a Flatlist
